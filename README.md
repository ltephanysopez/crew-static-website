CSS Grid is a technique in CSS that allows developers to create responsive web design layouts more easily and consistently across browsers.


#### Creating a two-dimensional layout
To make a two-dimensional layout, we’ll need to define the columns and rows. Let’s create three columns and two rows. To do this, we'll use the `grid-template-row` and `grid-template-column` properties.

```
#grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
}
```
