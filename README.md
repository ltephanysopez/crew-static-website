# ðŸ¤  _Hi! This is a mock-up website I've created to showcase to create columns and rows with CSS Grid._

Chances are, I've either directed you here, or you've been spelunking through my GitHub repos: in which case, welcome!  
This tutorial assumes you have some fundamental knowledge of HTML/CSS, but if you don't, that's okay too!
